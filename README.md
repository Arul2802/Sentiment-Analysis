**Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning (LSTM & RNN)**
**Overview**

This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model using Deep Learning techniques, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal is to classify text data (e.g., reviews, tweets, or comments) as positive, negative, or neutral.

**Features**

Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, padding, stopword removal, etc.)

Training an LSTM/RNN model on labeled sentiment datasets

Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Real-time sentiment prediction on new text inputs

Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (>=3.8)

TensorFlow/Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

NLTK (for text preprocessing)
**Dataset**

This project can be trained on any labeled sentiment dataset, such as:

IMDB Reviews Dataset

Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset

Amazon Reviews Dataset
**Results**
Ensure that the dataset is in CSV format with two columns: text and label (positive, negative, neutral).
Results

The model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

The results are saved in the results/ folder.

**Future Enhancements**
Use transformer-based models like BERT for better accuracy
